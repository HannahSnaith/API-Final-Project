# API-Final-Project
Project notes and Documentation

Why are we doing this?:
Going over all the skills learned on the course and bringing them altogether for a project. Previously we had been doing things one by one, not to bring together into an application with a purpose.

How I expected the challenge to go:
I thought I was going to make a different project at the start, but I realised I was thinking about it in the wrong way – thinking of a final app and multiple users rather than just an API.
I thought that the coding part was going to be the most difficult, but it turned out all of the other things (refreshing my memory from weeks ago on git for example) were a bit more tricky. I was worried about getting them wrong and mucking them up, breaking the code.
The testing stage was also the most difficult for me, I have learnt the importance of Agile methodology – my immediate reaction to this project was to follow a waterfall type methodology instead of testing as I went. This meant that it took longer to finish everything and I was fixing several mistakes in what I had already written. 

What went well? / What didn't go as planned:
Started with the idea to do a tracking app, started with trying to make users that would have their own daily logs but this wasn’t understanding the project properly.
What went well – I found writing the rest controllers actually alright to do, I followed the example from the previous week of a Person project (names of ages of people) and managed to get CRUD functionality working.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project:
Get better at testing (learn more about it), test as I write and don’t add more features until previous ones have all been tested. Follow the Agile methodology more closely.
